### Ex1: Taylor Approximation vs Pade Approximation

Everything (timing and error analysis) can be found in the notebook 'day1.ipynb'. The fastest implementation is the numpy one. We alredy know that, since numpy usually uses an optimized algorithm.

A plot of different Taylor approximations
![Figure_1](taylorapp.png)
One can easily see that:
* The approximation behaves badly on the boudary of the interval
* Higher the degree the better

![Figure_2](taylorvspade.png)
One can easily see that the PadÃ¨ well approximate the exponential in the constant region, but then behaves badly for $x > 5$.



An error analysis was also performed

### Ex2: Spline Approximation

In 'spline.c' I added the following function:

```c
double spl_exp(double x, double x0, double delta, double *xar, double *a, double *b)
{
  //int i = floor(x - x0)/delta + 1;
  int i = 0;
  while( x > xar[i]){
    i += 1;
  }
  return a[i] + b[i] * (x - xar[i - 1]);
 };
```

Below the output after the run:

```
time/set for 1000 x-values :   0.0495us
<x>: 0.0565471    <x**2> - <x>**2: 16.5517589247028

```
